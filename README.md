<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project is a single page application for a restaurant.
The website is built mainly with react.js, alongside Html,CSS and webpack for bundling of the assets<br>

The project has four tabs accessed via four routes: the home route, menu route, contacts route and the reservations route.

The significance of this project is:
<ol>
<li>It gives the restaurant a digital brand image, which is important in this digital age</li>
<li> Increase market reach by appealing to the new customer frontier, which is the internet.
</li>
<li>Allow the restaurant to receive feedback which it may use to improve services delivered.</li>
<li>Having a digital footprint is as important a marketing frontier as mainstream media, if not more. Moreover maintaining a website is much cheaper than running advertisement on mainstream media. You can also use google ads to increase your reach.
</li>
<li>A website also provides a platform to provide other services such as reservations, events and other services that can attract users and increase revenue growth.</li>
</ol>
